#+TITLE: Tracking RAM Usage
#+DATE: <2011-08-02>

Working on embedded projects sooner or later RAM becomes an issue. Then
it's a matter of going through the heavy RAM consumers and seeing what
can be squeezed.

I knocked up the following helper today while I was tracking down what was
using the RAM on my current project.

#+begin_src bash
    #!/usr/bash

    arm-none-eabi-nm -S -t d --size-sort $1 | \\
    awk '{if ($3 ~ /B|b|D|d/) {print $0; total += $2}} END{print "Total RAM Usage: " total}'
#+end_src
