#+title: SMB Printers with CUPS on Debian
#+date: 2010-06-30

I just spent a very frustrating couple of hours this afternoon trying to
get CUPS to event acknowledge smb printers existed. It would work
perfectly on my laptop with Ubuntu 10.04, and but on my Debian Squeeze
desktop. In the end I tracked it down to the following:

1. CUPS relies on =smbspool=. On Debian and Ubuntu this is provided by
   the =smbclient= package.

2. The permissions on =/usr/lib/cups/backend= had been change so it's
   contents could only be seen be root ([[http://www.compdigitec.com/labs/2010/01/16/fixing-usrlibcupsbackendsmb-failed-error-in-ubuntu/][this]] post put me on to this
   issue). I'm not sure why this being wrong didn't break everything.
   There is also a =/usr/lib/cups/backend-available= but for some
   reason there isn't an entry in this for smb.

Installing =smbclient= and fixing the permissions on
=/usr/lib/cups/backend= bought everything to life.
