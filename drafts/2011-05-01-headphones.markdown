I've been using the headphones for most of my technical career. If I
want to really concentrate on something, whether I'm at work or at
home I put on a pair of headphones.

## In the beginning

I bought my first pair of headphones in preparation for going to
university. The hall of residence where I was going to be staying
stressed the importance of a quite environment and I wanted to be able
to listen to music while I worked[^1]. 

[^1]: Once I moved in it turned out they put much less effort in to enforcing this, it could get noisy.

The first pair was a fairly basic Sony model.

## Getting specialised

- Philips noise cancellers
- Sennheiser wireless
- Panasonic noise cancellers

## The ultimate

Having used noise cancelling headphones and wireless headphones I
didn't really want to give up on either feature. At work I find noise
cancelling essential when I want to concentrate. On the other hand I
get pretty sick of cables draping ever where. Cables are also a
source of damage. Either to the cable it self, or because I get caught
up and pull the headphones off the desk on to the floor. Basically I
want both cancelling and wireless.

Believe it or not wireless noise cancelling headphones are not common.
I think this maybe because the design use for noise cancellers is
flying. Since I had a pair of noise cancellers I has happy with I got
a bluetooth receiver (A Sony BRC15 (TODO Check model)).

The combination of headphones and receiver meet the basic goal of
unteethering. It wasn't an elegant solution. The bluetooth receiver
need to be put in a dock to charge, so it couldn't be permanently
attached to the headphones. There was still a cable trailing around to
get hung up on things.
