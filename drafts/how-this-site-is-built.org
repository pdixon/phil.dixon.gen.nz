#+title: How this Site is Built

* Rendering

* Design

* Hosting

Since the site is entirely static files not much is need to host it. For
now I'm using [[http://][Amazon S3]]. This may change depending on the
traffic, but for now it lets me get this site on the web with out having
to spend any money up front.
