#+title: Arch Linux on Beaglebone

[[http://archlinuxarm.org/][Arch Linux Arm]] doesn't seem to offically
support the [[http://beagleboard.org/bone][Beaglebone]] yet. It does
support both the Gumstix Orevo and the Beagleboard. These both use
OMAP3s with A8 cores -- the SoC on the Beaglebone is closely related. It
also has an A8 and boots off an SD Card.
