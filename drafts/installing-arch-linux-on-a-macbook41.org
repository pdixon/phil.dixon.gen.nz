#+title: Installing Arch Linux on a Macbook4,1

* Installing Arch Linux on a Macbook4,1

** Booting

[[http://d.goodlad.net/articles/arch_linux_on_mba_42/][Arch Linux on a
Macbook Air 4,2 - David Goodlad]]

-  Used grub-efi-x86-64

-  Location of .efi seems to be important.

** Hardware

*** Wifi

Broadcom chipset. Mainline driver works well. Needs firmware cutter and
firmware from AUR.

TODO I'm sure this had 802.11N under Mac OSX. I'm only seeing G networks
on Arch.

*** Keyboard

The keyboard defaults to the function keys doing their special function.
Install pommed from AUR if you want to change this.

*** iSight

The driver was installed by default. Needs firmware to be operational.

*** Bluetooth

Disabled by default?? Not sure why or how to correct.

*** Video

-  Can't parse VBT. I think this is something to do with lack of BIOS.
   Things seem to be working though.

*** Sound

Optical port defaults to on. Mute the digital output in the audio
settings.
