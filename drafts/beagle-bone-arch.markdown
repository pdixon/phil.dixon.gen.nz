Title: Arch Linux on Beaglebone
Status: draft 

[Arch Linux Arm][alarm] doesn't seem to offically support the
[Beaglebone][bone] yet. It does support both the Gumstix Orevo and the
Beagleboard. These both use OMAP3s with A8 cores -- the SoC on the
Beaglebone is closely related. It also has an A8 and boots off an SD
Card.
